# WordPress Starter Theme

I developed this as a base theme for all of my custom WordPress sites. There are a ton of these out there which I used for inspiration, but this one was built specific to my workflow and built based of common needs/requests my clients have had. I wanted to keep it pretty bare-bones as a quick way to get a new project off the ground. 

Utilizes SCSS & SUSY for base styles and grid setup; Font-Awesome icons for quick and easy UI prototyping; and Gulp for task automation.
